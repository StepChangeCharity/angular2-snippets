# Adding your own snippet
1. Add a route for your example in **app.ts**
2. Add a new snippet area under **/snippets/09-your-folder** where **09** is the number of the **ol/li** in the home page (home.ts)
3. As far as possible keep all your code under the snippet area
4. Update **snippets/home** to reflect your new example.


## General area
Add useful starting points to **/templates** (e.g. scaffolding for a component)
