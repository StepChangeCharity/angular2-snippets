1. Add a route for your example in "proto.ts"
2. Add a new snippet area under "/snippets/09-your-folder" where "09" is the number of the "ol/li" in the home page
3. As far as possible keep all your code under the snippet area
4. Update "snippets/home" to reflect your new example.


== General area
Add useful starting points to "/templates" (e.g. scaffolding for a component)
